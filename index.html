			<p>
				In case you missed it, here's the email we sent out on 9/8 announcing our kickoff event:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
				Hello Potential New Members!
				</p>
				<p>
				We are so excited to announce the Enlight Student Organization kick-off is taking place tomorrow, Tuesday, September 9th! Enlight meets every Tuesday at 6:00 PM in front of Room 1099 within the Engineering Centers Building. If you do not know where ECB is located, please click <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/Yo1dX">here</a> for a Google interactive map/directions.
				</p>
				<p>
				We couldn't be more thrilled with what Enlight has in store for its newest members this year! Between Arduino projects, phone apps, changes in fountain hardware, Sector 67 field trips, and web building; we host all you would ever need for an engineering club! We will be providing short demonstrations on a variety of topics that Enlight has to offer, including a glance at our new server, student project planning, and even the history of the Maquina fountain!
				</p>
				<p>
				This is a very relaxed and open kick-off, so there is no need to prepare anything - just bring yourself, a pen, and perhaps even a friend!
				</p>
				<p>
				Hope to see you there!
				</p>
